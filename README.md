# secondary-isolations

This site was designed to fulfill a need in the laboratory I work in. In the laboratory, we isolate white blood cells from whole blood samples. 

By customer request, we sometimes perform a secondary isolation to further isolate a subset of the white blood cells. To do this, we use immunomagnetic separation kits. However, these kits come with only a paper manual, and require the operator to manually calculate and record how much reagent is required for each step, as well as other parameters like incubation and centrifuge spin requirements. 

This process is prone to human error due to miscalculations, misreading, and misinterpretation by other operators due to handwriting.

The purpose of this React app is to provide a user-friendly interface for lab operators to easily select, calculate, and print out the necessary parameters for kit(s). Users can also edit/add species and kits as needed.
